<h1>Welcome to Fhir Vital Sign Client Demo!</h1>
<p>
  FHIR is a platform specification that defines a set of capabilities use across the healthcare process, in all jurisdictions, and in lots of different contexts. While the basics of the FHIR specification are relatively straight-forward (see the Overviews: General, Developers, Clinical, and Architects), it can still be difficult to know where to start when implementing a solution based on FHIR.
